For this challenge I was able to find this youtube video that helped walk me through the steps needed to create the html and css for the start of this site. You can view the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFTvxsVv52k

Please note that I didn't fully utilise the code in the video and implemented my own styling and properties that made more sense to me and how I've been going about creating this. 

On top of that I also had a lot of long caffinated nights with google and my close friend that has been coding professionally for many years walk me through most of the Javascript. 

All in all this was a very challenging assignment for me and I'm still wrapping my brain around most of the javascript language but I'm becoming more and more confident in the HTML and CSS part of it all.
